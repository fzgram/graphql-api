## What Should I Know About Finland?

* We speak Finnish, English, and Swedish (poorly most often). [Check out our brief guide to Finnish](https://medium.com/react-finland/brief-guide-to-finnish-7f43f37d5017) in order to surprise the locals.
* We use euro as our currency.
* Finland is generally considered a safe country. Do **not** try to go past people in the grill queue, through, as that's a common way to find yourself in a trouble.
* Finland has about 5.5 million residents. That's about 1.6 times the population of Berlin spread around a big area. Whole Germany has roughly the same land area.
* Some Finns don't like if you tell them Finland is a part of Scandinavia. Technically a small part in the north is but some consider Finland as a culturally separate entity. The more inclusive term to use might be *fennoscandia* (Finland and the rest).

The venue is right in the center of historical area of Helsinki and it is one of the few ballrooms kept in its original form in Finland. The space fits up to 450 people and there's a separate bar in addition to the main space.
