  description: `Themes ease learning curves and reduce the time to a deployable app. Want to get that great blog written, but donâ€™t want to spend the time creating a bunch of components and UI details? Themes. Themes allow you to focus on what matters: delivering compelling experiences for your end users. Themes are coming very soon to Gatsby, and this talk will do a deep dive on what they are, how to use them, and the types of amazing content you can create easily with a framework that people love: Gatsby.`,
